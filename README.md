## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I am Rakesh

A full stack devloper from first batch of [neoG.Camp](https://neog.camp/),
who decided to learn coding during the pandemic, mostly out of boredom but then fell in love with it.
I like to experiment with different things . I can spends hours just to know the reason `WHY` . And I have never gave up even once during debugging .
